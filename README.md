# Anki themes

These are SASS and card format HTML files that I use for my Russian language study deck in Anki. Since I have multiple note types with both common and different features, I generate the CSS from SASS before pasting into the Anki card template editor.

If you're interested in how all this gets integrated into the cards in my deck, you can import the `.apkg` file into Anki.
